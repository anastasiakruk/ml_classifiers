# Machine Learning classifiers

This project allows testing different machine learning classifiers on several existing datasets.

You can download the datasets 

- [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)
- [Ionosphere](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ionosphere)
- [Mushroom](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom)

into a folder `data`.

Next, you should use `python3 main.py` for training and testing each model.
